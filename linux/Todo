Stuff to work on:

Fun stuff:
 - More backgrounds, sprites and stuff like that
 - Implement GUICHAN into HaxWorld for GUI's and stuff
 - More sounds effects!!! (preferably by PERSONAL recording (eg, guitar/keyboard) to avoid legal issues)

Boring stuff:
 - Finish animation stuff
 - Speed up video and general gameplay
 
Other stuff:
 - Just do stuff!!!

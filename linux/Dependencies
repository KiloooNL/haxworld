Dependencies:
- SDL          >= 1.2.13
- SDL_net      >= 1.2.7
- SDL_image    >= 1.2.7-1
- SDL_mixer    >= 1.2.8
- zziplib      >= 0.13.57
- libConfuse   >= 2.6

These packages may have their own deps as well.
The listed versions are just the versions on my development box.
Older versions of these libs may work as well.

For Ubuntu (and probably debian), you need the following packages to compile:
- libsdl1.2-dev
- libsdl-image1.2-dev
- libsdl-net1.2-dev
- libsdl-mixer1.2-dev
- libconfuse-dev
- libzzip-dev

Normal terminal:
cd ~/HaxWorld/src
g++ -o HaxWorld intro.c -lSDL

When using images libraries, just add -lSDL_image to the attributes.
